## [Demo of the project](https://hackernews-clone-krunal.herokuapp.com/)

1. I have created this project with latest version of React.
2. For persisting upvotes and hide feature, I have used local storage and manipulating the api response before showing it in UI.
3. I have used skeleton based loading feature instead of traditional loading indicator one.
