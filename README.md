## [Demo of the project](https://hackernews-clone-krunal.herokuapp.com/)

1. I have created this project with latest version of React.
2. For persisting upvotes and hide feature, I have used local storage and manipulating the api response before showing it in UI.
3. I have used skeleton based loading feature instead of traditional loading indicator one.
4. I had set up a CI CD pipeline using Travis CI and Heroku. So whenever we will push a new changes in master branch, it will deploy automatically the app to heroku.
5. I have created a service worker also to increase the Lighthouse score.
